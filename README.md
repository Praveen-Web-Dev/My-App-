# This repository contains the implementation of an interactive Streamlit dashboard developed as part of my MSc dissertation project at Sheffield Hallam University. The dashboard allows users to explore the global relationship between renewable energy adoption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across more than 150 countries (2000–2019).

📌 Features

Interactive visualisations of renewable energy shares, CO₂ emissions, GDP per capita, and energy intensity.

Country, region, and income-group filters for customised exploration.

Time-series trends and comparative charts.

Downloadable plots for policy and academic use.

Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7 & SDG 13).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+
